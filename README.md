# Bean and Brew Case Analysis
Authors: Jessie Liang, Jennifer Tsang

# About
The theme for this project is Sustanability and Profitability.

## Research questions:

1. Did the November 2023 rebrand impact revenue?
2. Did the increased advertising of their merch actually encourage reusable cup habits?
3. What are the tradeoffs between protecting the environment and making a profit?
4. Which kind of customers are more likely to bring their reusable cup?

## We performed:

**Data set cleaning & joining**: calculated product profit from items, merged it to the sales dataset, added cup profit to finally get total profit per transaction

**EDA**: visualize financial and environmental performance before/after Nov 2023

**Statistical analysis**: z-test 

**Simple modeling**: logistic regression

## We provided: 

Business suggestions based on EDA, modelling and statistical tests
